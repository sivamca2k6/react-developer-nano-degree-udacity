# Chirper Project 

This is an code-along project as part of React-Redux module.

## Project Walkthrough
To help you solidify your understanding of React and Redux, we will do a project walkthrough. The project we'll be building is called "Redux-Twitter-Clone-App". Building this simple Twitter clone will help you practice improving the predictability of an application's state; establishing strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store; and identifying what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components.

## Planning Your React/Redux App's Architecture
In the Planning Stage, we will go over 4 steps that will help you come up with your app's architecture, which is often the trickiest part.

A Guide for the Planning Stages of Your Project :
1.  Identify What Each View Should Look Like
2.  Break Each View Into a Hierarchy of Components
3.  Determine What Events Happen in the App
4.  Determine What Data Lives in the Store
