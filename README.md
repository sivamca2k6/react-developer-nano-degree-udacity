# Udacity Nano Degree - React Developer 

Tech Stack

 * **React JS** 
 * **Redux** 
 * **React Native** 
 * **GIT** for source version control.
 * **VS Code** as IDE.

## Overview

Congratulations on considering the React Nanodegree program! Before you get started, make sure to set
aside adequate time on your calendar for focused work, and double-check that you meet the requirements:
you should have prior programming experience that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming.

The React Nanodegree program is comprised of 3 courses and 3 projects. Each project you build will be an
opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in your lessons. Your completed projects become part of a
career portfolio that will demonstrate your mastery of React to potential employers.

Prerequisites:
Students should have prior development experience building and deploying front-end applications with HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub, NPM, and experience using the command line interface (bash, terminal).

Educational Objectives:
By the end of the React Nanodegree program, students will be able to:
- Create React components that make use of props, state, event handlers, and data propagation.
- Create React applications that use lifecycle methods and React Router, handle asynchronous requests,
and effectively manage state.
- Create React/Redux applications that handle asynchronous requests and combine the state management
features of Redux and the component model of React.
- Create React Native applications that effectively manage state and use React Navigation, AsyncStorage,
and proper styling.

## Course : React Fundamentals

Mastering React begins with learning your fundamentals, and this can pose a bit of a challenge, because
while the modularity of the React ecosystem makes it really powerful for building applications, there is a
great deal to learn. So we’ll break everything down, and enable you to learn the foundational parts of the
React ecosystem that are necessary to build production-ready apps.

As this is a project-based course, you’re going to start building right away. This gives you an opportunity to
get your hands dirty with React, and start mastering the skills you’ll need. Plus, every project you build is
reviewed by an expert Project Reviewer, and their detailed feedback will be instrumental in helping you to
advance.


## Course : React & Redux

Redux excels at state management, and in this course, you'll learn how Redux and React work together to
make your application's state bulletproof.

As with the previous course, this is hand-on curriculum, and building projects is what it’s all about. Here,
you’ll leverage React with Redux to build "Would You Rather", a popular party game.

## Course : React Native

In this course, you'll learn how to to develop React applications that run on both iOS and Android devices.
We’ll explore everything from setting up a proper development environment, building and styling a
cross-platform mobile application. You’ll incorporate native APIs such as geolocation and local notifications,
and even learn how to get your app ready for the Google Play Store and the App Store!


## Project 1 - MyReads: A Book Lending App

In this project, you will create a React application from scratch and utilize React components to manage the
user interface. You’ll create a virtual bookcase to store your books and track what you're reading. Using the
provided Books API, you’ll search for books and add them to a bookshelf as a React component. Finally,
you’ll use React's setState to build the functionality to move books from one shelf to another.

## Project 2 - Would You Rather
Leverage the strengths of Redux to build a "Would You Rather" application in which users are given
questions and must choose one of them. You’ll build this dynamic application from scratch while combining
the state management features of Redux and the component model of React. When complete, you’ll be able
to create your own sets of questions, choose between them, and keep track of question popularity.

## Project 3 - Mobile Flashcards

In this project, you'll use React Native to build a mobile flashcard app. Users will not only be able to create
custom cards and decks, but they’ll also be able to set up notifications to remind them to study. You’ll
leverage React Native components, AsyncStorage, proper styling, as well as device APIs to create a fully
dynamic experience
